# CODSOFT_LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This Library Management System is developed in C++ to manage the books, borrowers, and transactions in a library. The system allows librarians to add books, register borrowers, check out and return books, and search for books by title, author, or ISBN. It also includes a fine calculation feature for overdue books.
